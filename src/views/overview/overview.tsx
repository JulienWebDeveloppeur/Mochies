          Our team has seen it all and we’re looking to provide the most scarce
          resource to our community: authenticity. We’ve encountered plenty of
          projects that fail to provide real value to their holders with
          extensive roadmaps. We’re switching things up. The first phase of our
          project is in full effect where all members are vetted to join
          Hyperium’s Alpha Origins. These members form the foundation of our
          project and are future holders of our NFT. Providing alpha, tools &
          consistent collaborations for free has allowed us to provide abundant
          value upfront to our early adopters. We know they will be with us for
          the long run.
